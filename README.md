# Hello O/

- I’m @JacobSturgess, a biosciences masters student at the University of Exeter.
- I’m currently learning Python and Matlab.
- My current project aims to use machine learning techniques to characterise bacteriophage plaques for use in therapy.

My project is an extension on [this important study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo) by Stephen T. Abedon at Oxford University.
